# HackwithHyderabad 3.0 — Pre-Planning Repository

**Status:** Pre-planning (no final project selected)\
**Hackathon:** HackwithHyderabad 3.0\
**Required Technology:** [Hindsight by Vectorize](https://hindsight.vectorize.io/)\
**Team:** 2 members (see [Team Status](#team-status))\
**Purpose:** Shared planning documentation for team discussion before implementation

***

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository contains structured pre-planning documents to help the team:

* Understand hackathon requirements and constraints

* Evaluate five candidate project ideas objectively

* Compare ideas against judging criteria and technical feasibility

* Align on system-design principles before writing code

* Plan demo narratives for each candidate

* Track decisions, assumptions, and open questions

**Important:** No final project has been selected. All five ideas are candidates under evaluation.

## Team Status

**Team Member 1**\
Background: VLSI Physical Design, Engineering workflows, AI evaluation, RLHF, Prompt engineering, LLMs, RAG, AI agents, Technical research\
Personal research: EGER (Evidence-Grounded Engineering Reasoning) — *background inspiration only, not a validated framework*

**Team Member 2**\
Name: Mukul\
Background: To be documented after discussion

***

## Planned Workflow

1. **Review this documentation** — Both members read all documents
2. **Team discussion** — Answer questions in [docs/decision-log.md](docs/decision-log.md)
3. **Select final project** — Record decision in decision log
4. **Implementation planning** — Create detailed spec, architecture, task breakdown
5. **Build** — Implement with Hindsight as central memory layer
6. **Demo preparation** — Record 2–5 minute demo video
7. **Content creation** — Technical article + social post per member
8. **Submission** — GitHub repo, live demo, video, content deliverables

## Key Constraints to Remember

- Hindsight memory must be **central**, not superficial
- Solve a **real professional problem** for a **specific persona**
- Demonstrate a **visible learning curve** (before/after memory)
- Keep **scope tight** — one workflow, one persona, one value prop
- Use **realistic data**, not toy examples
- Build something **portfolio-worthy**
- Do NOT claim Hindsight guarantees better results
- Separate: *previous experience* → *current evidence* → *agent reasoning* → *final outcome*

---

## Core Design Question

**"What changes because the agent remembers?"**

This is the central evaluation question for all candidate ideas. A strong memory workflow should resemble:

```
Interaction 1
    → experience retained
    → later/new case
    → relevant memory recalled
    → agent behavior changes
    → current evidence checked
    → outcome
    → new experience retained
```

Contrast with a weak pattern:
```
User question
    → retrieve old conversation
    → generate answer
```

Simple conversation-history retrieval is insufficient for demonstrating meaningful persistent memory.

## Collaboration

- GitHub is the single source of truth; `main` is the shared stable branch.
- Mukul (`mukul-raii`) is a collaborator.
- Do substantial work in branches (e.g. `rama-planning`, `mukul-ideas`), not directly on `main`.
- Changes are reviewed through Pull Requests before merging.
- Planning decisions are recorded in [docs/decision-log.md](docs/decision-log.md).
- Workflow details: [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [docs/collaboration-workflow.md](docs/collaboration-workflow.md).
